# Expo Mimic APP

An Electron application with React

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Running
When you run the start script you will get an app to edit and save data as well as an express server running on port 3000. This servers as the API for the XBLE Module to use inside of React Native.

## Plans
Currently this is being built to support a personal project but if there becomes users and usage expanding and building will happen. Same goes for the module. It is currently built out very minimally to just locally test and go faster. Extending should be easy. See that repo/package for details and documentation.
